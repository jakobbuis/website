    <h1>
        New Opportunities TL;DR
    </h1>

    <p>
        I work as a freelance engineering leader. Specializing in getting teams (back) on track quickly and
        permanently. Are you seeking an experienced engineering manager with a knack for reviving teams and accelerating
        their performance? Look no further.
    </p>
    <p>
        Can I help you? Contact me at <a href="tel:+31681130415">+31 6 811 30 415</a> and <a
            href="mailto:jakob@cubiso.nl">jakob@cubiso.nl</a>, or reach out via <a

    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>
        <em>I build effective software engineering teams.</em> I can help your company if you have a starting team that
        needs help building their processes, or an existing team that has grown beyond its current capabilities and
        started slowing down. Or similar scenarios like creating a more reliable delivery of value.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm happy to write some code -- still do it as a hobby! -- and can build solid systems, but it's not the primary
        point of leverage: I do most of my work through people. Understanding engineer's needs &amp; goals, aligning
        teams and individuals to business goals, and guiding &amp; coaching.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've helped various organisations in the past including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IN10: a creative digital agency</li>
        <li>VCSW: a Dutch startup, saving businesses money on employment taxes</li>
        <li>Ridder: a large horticulture technology company</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I need from you</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Building software is part of your core business.</li>
        <li>You employ 2+ teams of software engineers, usually 10+ people.</li>
        <li>You either operate fully remote or are located close enough to <a

                the Netherlands</a>, so I can go in to your offices regularly.</li>
        <li>You are not operating a crypto- or gambling-related product.</li>
    </ul>
